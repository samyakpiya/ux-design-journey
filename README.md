## Key Learnings

The goal of this course was to introduce me to the field of user experience and understand its importance for consumers and businesses.

### Course 1: Foundations of User Experience Design

**History of UX**: The phrase UX was first coined in the 1990s, by cognitive psychologist, Don Norman, as the technology used expanded and evolved. In the tech world, UX mostly focuses on how people use or interact with products.

**User Experience (UX)** is how a person, the user, feels about interacting with, or experiencing a product.
**UX Designers** help make technology easier to understand and more enjoyable to use.
**Product** is a good, service, or feature.

Types of UX Designers:

1. **Interaction Designer** - focuses on the experience of a product and how it functions.
2. **Visual Designer** - focuses on how the product looks (e.g.: logos, illustrations, icons, font color, size, layouts)
3. **Motion Designer** - focuses on what it feels like for a user to move through a product (smooth transition of pages)

People a UX Designer would collaborate with:

1. **UX Researcher** conducts studies or interviews that help us learn how people use a product.
2. **UX Writers** think about how to make the language within a product clearer.
3. **Product Designers** make sure the first and final designs match the finished product materials and that the assets are ready to be handed to the engineering team.
4. **UX Engineers** translate the design intent into a functional experience like a website or an app.
5. **UX Program Managers** ensure clear and timely communication so that the process of building a useful product moves smoothly from start to finish (setting up goals, writing project plans).

**Product Development Lifecycle**: The process used to take a product from an idea to reality:

1. **Brainstorm**: An active discovery stage that's all about generating ideas about the user and potential needs or challenges the user might have.
2. **Define**: Using the insights from the brainstorming stage and starting to narrow the focus (who is the product for, what will the product do, what features need to be included for the product to be successful)
3. **Design**: Implementing insights into new designs using various tools
4. **Test**: Evaluating the product design based on feedback from potential users.
5. **Launch**: Sharing a finished version of the product with the public (listing an app in the app store, making a website live).

**Good Design**: Good design considers the user's design needs. For the user to have a good experience, the product needs to be:

1. Usable - easy to use.
2. Equitable - consider people from different backgrounds (people with disabilities).
3. Enjoyable - should make the user happy.
4. Useful - should solve a problem.

**Responsibilities of an entry-level UX Designer**:

- Researching: Understand audiences and learn about their backgrounds, demographics, motivations, pain points, emotions, and life goals.
- Wireframing: An outline or sketch of a product or a screen.
- Prototyping: Early model of a product that demonstrates functionality.
- Creating information architecture: The framework of a website or how it's organized, categorized, and structured.
- Communicating effectively: Meeting with colleagues, writing emails, creating proposals, and pitching clients.

**Roles**:

- Generalist: A UX designer with a broad number of responsibilities (coding, prototyping, visual design, UX Research, writing).
- Specialist: Dives deep into 1 particular UX design role, like interaction, visual, or motion design.
- T-Shaped Designer: Specializes in one kind of UX design and has a breadth of knowledge in other areas (Generalist + Specialist).

**Week 1 Recap**: Explored the realm of User Experience (UX) design, including its elements and relevance in shaping mobile apps, websites, and other products. Became familiar with the responsibilities of UX designers and the teams they commonly collaborate with. Looked into career opportunities and paths available post-certificate program completion.

**Week 2 Recap**: Familiarized myself with critical terms, tools, and frameworks in UX design, with an emphasis on user-centric design principles. Understood the significance of equity and accessibility in design, and grasped the concept of designing for seamless user experiences across platforms.

**Week 3 Recap**: Participated in design sprints, a common practice for UX designers to guide product direction. Learned about the different phases of a design sprint and gained insights into planning and participation. Reflected on the design sprint via retrospectives to identify areas of improvement for future sprints.

**Week 4 Recap**: Integrated research into the design process, keeping user needs at the core of design decisions. Explored the role of research in fostering empathy for users, and analyzed the benefits and drawbacks of common UX research methods. Identified and addressed potential biases that can emerge when conducting research.
