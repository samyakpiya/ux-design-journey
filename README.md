## Key Learnings

The goal of this course was to introduce me to the field of user experience and understand its importance for consumers and businesses.

### Course 1: Foundations of User Experience Design

## Week 1

Explored the realm of User Experience (UX) design, including its elements and relevance in shaping mobile apps, websites, and other products. Became familiar with the responsibilities of UX designers and the teams they commonly collaborate with. Looked into career opportunities and paths available post-certificate program completion.

**History of UX**: The phrase UX was first coined in the 1990s, by cognitive psychologist, Don Norman, as the technology used expanded and evolved. In the tech world, UX mostly focuses on how people use or interact with products.

**User Experience (UX)** is how a person, the user, feels about interacting with, or experiencing a product.
**UX Designers** help make technology easier to understand and more enjoyable to use.
**Product** is a good, service, or feature.

Types of UX Designers:

1. **Interaction Designer** - focuses on the experience of a product and how it functions.
2. **Visual Designer** - focuses on how the product looks (e.g.: logos, illustrations, icons, font color, size, layouts)
3. **Motion Designer** - focuses on what it feels like for a user to move through a product (smooth transition of pages)

People a UX Designer would collaborate with:

1. **UX Researcher** conducts studies or interviews that help us learn how people use a product.
2. **UX Writers** think about how to make the language within a product clearer.
3. **Product Designers** make sure the first and final designs match the finished product materials and that the assets are ready to be handed to the engineering team.
4. **UX Engineers** translate the design intent into a functional experience like a website or an app.
5. **UX Program Managers** ensure clear and timely communication so that the process of building a useful product moves smoothly from start to finish (setting up goals, writing project plans).

**Product Development Lifecycle**: The process used to take a product from an idea to reality:

1. **Brainstorm**: An active discovery stage that's all about generating ideas about the user and potential needs or challenges the user might have.
2. **Define**: Using the insights from the brainstorming stage and starting to narrow the focus (who is the product for, what will the product do, what features need to be included for the product to be successful)
3. **Design**: Implementing insights into new designs using various tools
4. **Test**: Evaluating the product design based on feedback from potential users.
5. **Launch**: Sharing a finished version of the product with the public (listing an app in the app store, making a website live).

**Good Design**: Good design considers the user's design needs. For the user to have a good experience, the product needs to be:

1. Usable - easy to use.
2. Equitable - consider people from different backgrounds (people with disabilities).
3. Enjoyable - should make the user happy.
4. Useful - should solve a problem.

**Responsibilities of an entry-level UX Designer**:

- Researching: Understand audiences and learn about their backgrounds, demographics, motivations, pain points, emotions, and life goals.
- Wireframing: An outline or sketch of a product or a screen.
- Prototyping: Early model of a product that demonstrates functionality.
- Creating information architecture: The framework of a website or how it's organized, categorized, and structured.
- Communicating effectively: Meeting with colleagues, writing emails, creating proposals, and pitching clients.

**Roles**:

- Generalist: A UX designer with a broad number of responsibilities (coding, prototyping, visual design, UX Research, writing).
- Specialist: Dives deep into 1 particular UX design role, like interaction, visual, or motion design.
- T-Shaped Designer: Specializes in one kind of UX design and has a breadth of knowledge in other areas (Generalist + Specialist).

**Types of companies that hire UX Designers**
**Startup** A new business that wants to develop a unique product or service and bring it to market.
**Freelancers** Work for themselves and market their services to businesses to find customers.
**Advertising Agencies** Teams of creatives hired by clients to build marketing campaigns.
**Design Agency** A one-stop shop for the look of brands, products, and services.
**Big Companies** like Google, Meta, Apple, etc.

## Week 2

Familiarized myself with critical terms, tools, and frameworks in UX design, with an emphasis on user-centric design principles. Understood the significance of equity and accessibility in design, and grasped the concept of designing for seamless user experiences across platforms.

**Accessibility**: The design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disability.
**Equality**: Providing the same amount of opportunity and support to all segments of society. In other words, everyone gets the same thing.
**Equity**: Providing different levels of opportunity and support for each person in order to achieve fair outcomes.
**Iteration**: Doing something again, by building on previous versions and making tweaks.
**User**: A person who has a problem and is looking for a product or service to help them solve it.
**Assistive Technology**: Any products, equipment, and systems that enhance learning, working, and daily living for people with disabilities. Different types of assistive technologies: color modification, voice control, screen readers, and alternative text.
**Switch**: An assistive technology device that replaces the need to use a computer keyboard or mouse.

**UX Design Frameworks**:

1. **Universal Design**: The process of creating one product for users with the widest range of abilities and in the widest range of situations (basically, proposing one solution for everyone). The drawback of this is that the designs lose their effectiveness. It's often difficult to achieve any goals with a product when there are so many intended users. Example: You go to a hat store that only sells the same size hat for everyone. Turns out, by doing so, you'll still have people for whom the hats are not a fit.

2. **Inclusive Design**: Making design choices that take into account personal identifiers like:

- Ability
- Race
- Economic Status
- Language
- Age
- Gender

3. **Equity-focused Design**: Thinking through all the aspects of a designed product and making sure the product is both accessible and fair to all genders, races, and abilities. Plus, the design needs to specifically consider underrepresented and excluded groups.

Make sure the designs don't have a bias towards what is considered the culturally accepted norm. For example, imagine you have a form that asks respondents to select their gender. One form gives three choices: male, female, and other. The second form offers a wide range of choices: male, female, gender-nonconforming, non-binary, and blank-field (to allow for a written answer). The second form is much more likely to make everyone feel included, and it will also probably do a better job of gathering accurate data.

Another example of how equity affects gender is with public restrooms. If a business offers a men's room and a woman's room with the same number of stalls, that would be an example of equality. But, that is not an equitable design. For one, people identifying as female often need more time, which means the bathrooms are more crowded. Plus, people who identify as gender-nonconforming or non-binary are not included at all. Restrooms that are gender neutral, however, are an example of physical space that's designed to treat everyone equitably. Everyone, no matter their gender identity, has the same opportunity to use each bathroom.

Let's review a few ways this has played out in the tech industry. When voice assistants were first introduced at Google, they were trained primarily with male, native English-speaking voices. As a result, the voice assistants could easily understand and respond to male voices. But, they had a hard time understanding female voices, because of the higher pitch, and voices of people with strong accents. When the product launched, users were extremely frustrated when the assistant could not understand them. This example highlights how testing with a diverse set of users can truly improve a product.

Another important aspect of designing for equity is using **inclusive images**. Imagine you're designing an app and you need to create an illustration to use as a mock profile photo when a user hasn't added their profile photo to their account yet. What does that illustration look like? As a designer, would you automatically create a picture that looks like you? Or would you be more inclusive in your representation? Representing diverse people through icons, illustrations, and photographs requires viewing everything we design through a critical lens.

4. **User-centered Design**: Puts the user front-and-center. Why is it important that designs are centered on the user? Because the user buys and uses your product. In addition, it's also important to solve problems that people actually experience, rather than only trying to solve problems you personally experience. Focusing on real user problems reduces the impact of designer bias. Four steps in this framework:

- **Understand** how the user experiences the product or similar products. This takes a lot of research.
- **Specify** the end user's needs. Based on your research, you will narrow down which user problem is the most important to solve
- **Design** solutions to the end user's problem. This is where you come up with ideas for what the product might look like and start building the product.
- **Evaluate** your design against the end user's needs. Does the design solve the end user's problem? This is where you will find out, and you'll also do it by testing your product with real people.
  As you do this, iteration will be key. Real-world Example:

```
5 years ago, Google launched Google Photos as a place to store photos and keep them organized. Overtime, they noticed that users also wanted to revisit memories and relive treasured moments. To make it easier for users to do this, Google used the user-centered design process to redesign Google Photos. Now users can easily search to find their memories.
```

**Week 3 Recap**: Participated in design sprints, a common practice for UX designers to guide product direction. Learned about the different phases of a design sprint and gained insights into planning and participation. Reflected on the design sprint via retrospectives to identify areas of improvement for future sprints.

**Week 4 Recap**: Integrated research into the design process, keeping user needs at the core of design decisions. Explored the role of research in fostering empathy for users, and analyzed the benefits and drawbacks of common UX research methods. Identified and addressed potential biases that can emerge when conducting research.
